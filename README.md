A very simple HTTP client based in PHP curl functions

# TODO:

 * ~~Add the HTTP header option to the option map (CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER)~~
 * Make a cool description of the class in the README
 * Document the protected methods
 * ~~Implement the put and delete methods~~
 * Implement the others HTTP methods (HEAD, PATH, OPTIONS at least)
 * Generate better and more documented examples (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods and upload file)
 * ~~Refactor the code to a more DRY version~~
 * Write an article for my blog explaining the use of the class and how it works curl in PHP
 * ~~Use http_build_query to build the query string for the GET  method~~
